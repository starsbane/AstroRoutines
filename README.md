# AstroRoutines
An unoffical .NET Core clone of C Library of the Standards of Fundamental Astronomy (SOFA) software libraries from International Astronomical Union (IAU), provides a collection of subroutines that implement official IAU algorithms for astronomical computations.

This package is based on SOFA ANSI C Release 19 (2023-10-11) and distributed under GPLv3 license.

Please refer to <a href="https://www.iausofa.org/">their website</a> for details regarding the SOFA releases.

# WHat is SOFA?

SOFA operates under the auspices of the International Astronomical Union (IAU) to provide algorithms and software for use in astronomical computing. The initiative is managed by an international panel, the SOFA Board, appointed through IAU Division A. The Board obtains the latest IAU-approved models and theories from the fundamental-astronomy community, implements them as computer code and checks them for accuracy. SOFA works closely with all the Commissions of the Division and with the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS).

The SOFA Collection consists of two libraries of routines, one coded in Fortran 77 the other in ANSI C. There is a suite of vector/matrix routines and various utilities that underpin the astronomy algorithms, which include routines for the following:

Astrometry
Calendars
Time Scales
Ecliptic Coordinates
Earth Rotation and Sidereal Time
Ephemerides (medium precision)
Fundamental Arguments
Galactic Coordinates
Geocentric/Geodetic Transformations
Precession, Nutation and Polar Motion
Star Catalog Conversion
